## Overview

Biomass and leaf area data were provided by Malia Gehan's group as Excel sheets with multiple tabs, indicating different experiments and data types. Some leaf biomass and area data are extracted and used in 02_parameter_upload.Rmd to calculate SLA, a key parameter needed for crop and ecological models. Other biomass data is used to determine biomass partitioning across life stages. 

Biomass data also serves an important role in model validation. In a recent model run comparing high night temperature to the control, the biomass data exhibited large variation, which was attributed to possible differences in chamber and tier. Therefore, here we collate all biomass data for the chambers in order to try to detect the influence of chamber and tier. 

```{r library}
library(dplyr)
library(readxl)
```

Read in the Excel sheet of chamber experiment biomass data, which are found in the [sentinel-detection repository](https://github.com/danforthcenter/sentinel-detection). Nine of fifteen tabs describe biomass from the 9 chamber experiments.

## Experiments

Experiment 1 was conducted on ME034V-1 in 3 chambers (157, 158, and 159), set to day/night temperatures of 22, 31, and 36, respectively. In all chambers, the 3 tiers were set to different light levels of 150 in the low tier, 250 in the mid tier, and 450 in the high tier.

```

Experiment 2 was conducted on ME034V-1 and mutants Les1 and Les5 in 3 chambers (157, 158, and 159). All chambers were set to temperatures of 34. In each chamber, biomass samples of Les1 were taken from low and mid tiers, Les 5 was taken from low and high tiers, and ME034V-1 was taken from all three tiers. Light is currently unknown.

                          tier == "top" ~ "high"))
```

Experiment 3 was conducted on ME034V-1 in 3 chambers (157, 158, and 159) and consisted of the application of GA_1 and GA_2 at different light and temperature combinations. Chamber 157 was set to a temperature of 33, while chambers 158 and 159 were set to 24. The high tier of each chamber was set to 450 light, while the low and mid tiers were set to 250. All three treatments (GA_1, GA_2, and control) were undertaken in each light and temprature combination.
